### **CSS Positioning Assignment**

#### **Objective:**

Understand and apply different CSS positioning properties (`static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, `sticky`) to build a layout that incorporates these concepts.

### **Assignment Instructions:**

1. **Create a webpage layout** with the following requirements:  
   * **Header** at the top of the page.  
   * **Sidebar** on the left side of the page.  
   * **Main content area** that takes up most of the space in the center.  
   * **Footer** at the bottom of the page.  
2. Use **different CSS positioning techniques** to place each element:  
   * The **header** should use the `sticky` position, so it sticks to the top of the viewport as you scroll down the page.  
   * The **sidebar** should be positioned using `absolute` positioning but remain inside a parent container.  
   * The **main content** should have a `relative` position so it moves slightly based on its normal flow.  
   * The **footer** should use the `fixed` position so it stays at the bottom of the viewport even when scrolling.  
3. **Add a floating button** to the layout:  
   * The button should be placed in the bottom-right corner of the viewport.  
   * Use `position: fixed` to make the button stay in place as the user scrolls.  
   * Style the button to be easily visible and clearly indicate that it's clickable.

### **Requirements:**

* Use **HTML** for the structure and **CSS** for styling and positioning.  
* Add some **basic styles** (background colors, padding, and margins) to make the layout visually clear.  
* Create a **minimum of 4 paragraphs** of text in the main content area to make scrolling necessary. use lorem ipsum.  
* Ensure the **floating button** stays in the bottom-right corner regardless of scrolling.

### **Bonus Challenge (Optional):**

* Add an image inside the sidebar and make it remain in place when scrolling (similar to the sidebar sticking to the top after scrolling down a bit).  
* Add popover with position `absolute`. This popover  should be visible when the user hover a link on the header
