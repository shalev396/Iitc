//chapter D Data Types
//1. number
//2. str="any string";
//3. null is the value of a pointer that lead to nothing (Array index that is out of its length)
// and undefined is the value of a pointer that lead to a valuable which have on value
//4. typeOf()
//5. Numbers
//6. Boolean
//7. let user =new User{name:"shalev", pass:"1234", phoneNumber:"0544809493"};
//8. NaN is the result of operating math methods on non number types of valuables
//9. the === return true only if both values are strictly the same
//and == can be true if the value is the same even if the data type are different
//10. Number(str);
//11. Numbers
//12. if(val.typeOf()===Numbers) this example is for numbers but can be replaced for (String,Boolean,object,ect)
//13. here is an example
// let text = `The quick
// brown fox
// jumps over
// the lazy dog`;
// console.log(text);
//14. all of them are pretty much the same but same but back-tick allows you to use string templating
//15. toString()
//16. object
//17. const
//18. if the string is made out of numbers then str="5" x=x+str will work
// but if string dose not contain numbers str="apple" then it returns NaN
//19. boolean
//20. using the appropriate "",'',`` it depends on the special letter
//21.var is the old way that is unpredictable let is used for valuables that can change in value
//const is used for valuables that can`t change in values
//22. if(typeOf()===undefine)
//23. 15
//24. let bool=true;
//25.object holds in them many primitive values that call properties and primitivs are Numbers Strings Boolean,ect.
